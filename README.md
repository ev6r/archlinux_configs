Jerry's archlinux configurations
===
Background
----------

All the configurations of my **Archlinux** are tracked here. Now the state of my laptop is statble with them, so I will maintain the list whatever has changed.   
*  `rc.lua`
* `.bashrc`
* `.Xdefault`
+ `.Xmodmap`
+ `.xinitrc`
* `slim.conf`
